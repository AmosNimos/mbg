> Motion Background Glitch 

Animation example:
~~~ bash
./mbg.sh -s Skull.jpg -u 6 -o 0 -a 60
~~~
Skull.jpg
![Skull.jpg](Skull.jpg)
Procedurally animate your wallpaper with a hacker/glitch effect, featuring random hue shifts and chromatic aberration for a striking boot-up display.

> Note: I just started studies in the field of cyber security and server management and wanted something to flex a little when I bring my fully customized laptop. I already have a custom boot animation and pretty much everything is riced to the bone, but adding this and maybe playing a cool boot-up soundtrack would take the cake.
